# My Personal Project

## Description

The project I want to develop is a Snake game. The game will be a single player game where the player controls a snake
that grows in length as it eats food (apple). The snake will move at a constant speed and the player will be able to
control the direction of the snake. The game will end when the snake collides with itself or the wall.  

The user can choose the difficulty of the game. The difficulty will be determined by the speed of the snake. The user
can also pause and save the game and resume it later.  

During the game, the achievements of the player will be recorded and displayed at the end of the game. The achievements
are a number of special events that the player can achieve during the game. For example, the player can achieve a "The
Chosen One" achievement if the snake eats 10 apples in a row without colliding with itself or the wall. The statistics
of the game will also be displayed at the end of the game. The statistics include the score, the number of keystrokes,
the play time, and the number of achievements the player has achieved.
